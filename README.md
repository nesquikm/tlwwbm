# The Last Word Will Be Mine!

## Overview

This is a Solana-based on-chain game where players compete to have the last word on various topics. Users can create topics by paying a fixed fee and writing an initial comment. Others can reply by replacing the existing comment, with the cost increasing for each replacement, creating a dynamic competition.

Each topic can hold only one active comment at a time. Topics can be locked permanently after a set period, and the last commenter earns a larger share of the accumulated fees. When this happens, the topic creator receives a share of the accumulated fees, the last commenter earns a larger share along with a thematic NFT (TBD), and the topic becomes a permanent part of the game history.

While the topic has no comments, the topic creator can delete it and receive a full refund. The game challenges players to strategically manage their spending, compete for rewards, and claim the ultimate prize of having the “last word.”
